Description: Panzenella is a Tuscan bread salad, ideal for summer. It does not follow a particular recipe, but the two ingredients that do not change are tomatoes and bread. This salad is great with a chilled glass of Prosecco and lots of sunshine!

Ingredients:
3 tablespoons good olive oil.
1 small French bread or boule, cut into 1-inch cubes (6 cups)
1 teaspoon kosher salt.
2 large, ripe tomatoes, cut into 1-inch cubes.
1 hothouse cucumber, unpeeled, seeded, and sliced 1/2-inch thick.
1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into 1-inch cubes.
